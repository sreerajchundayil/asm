#My notes for assembly language learning.
#I am using AT&T format for this notes.

General steps to compile the abc.s file

#When using _start as entry point
------------------------------------
.section .text
  .global _start
 _start:
  movq $60, %rax
  movq $100, %rdi
  syscall
  ret
  
  ---
  This is an AT&T format
  save this in asm.asm file
  
  To compile this
  as asm.asm -o asm.o
  ld asm.o
  ./a.out
  echo $? --> 100
  
  In the above sampe we are using $60 in %rax , which means an exit call. And the return value will be from %rdi
  
  
#When using gcc for compiling the asm file.
#main will be the entry point
------------------------------------
  .section .text
    .global main
 main:
  movq $60, %rax
  ret
  
  save this in asm.s
  The file extension should be ".s" for the file
  gcc asm.s -o output
  
  ./output --> 60
