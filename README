.section .text
  .global _start
 _start:
  movq $60, %rax
  movq $100, %rdi
  syscall
  ret
  
  ---
  This is an AT&T format
  save this in asm.asm file
  
  To compile this
  as asm.asm -o asm.o
  ld asm.o
  ./a.out
  echo $? --> 100
  
  In the above sampe we are using $60 in %rax , which means an exit call. And the return value will be from %rdi
  
  
  ########################
  .section .text
    .global main
 main:
  movq $60, %rax
  ret
  
  save this in asm.asm
  gcc asm.asm -o output
  
  ./output --> 60
  
  This should have main as the starting point.
  The return value will be picked from %rax
